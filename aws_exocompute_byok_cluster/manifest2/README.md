# Manifest2 Module
The manifest2 module parses the Kubernetes manifest received from the
`polaris_aws_exocompute_cluster_attachment` resource and creates TF
`kubernetes_manifest` resources from the content.

Due to this module using the `kubernetes_manifest` resource it cannot be used
by Terraform until the Kubernetes cluster has been created. The reason for this
is that `kubernetes_manifest` requires access to the Kubernetes cluster during
Terraform plan time.

To work around this start by creating the Kubernetes cluster using the Terraform
`-target` command line option:
```bash
$ terraform apply -target=module.eks_cluster
```

This will onboard the AWS account using the account module and create the AWS
EKS cluster using the EKS cluster module. Next, apply the rest of the
Terraform configuration:
```bash
$ terraform apply
```

> [!CAUTION]
> The resources in the Kubernetes manifest generated by RSC needs to be applied
> in a specific order. This module tries to replicate the order by applying the
> Kubernetes resources in order based on their Kubernetes kind. This might not
> work in future versions of the manifest. The manifest1 module will always
> apply the Kubernetes resources in the correct order.
