# Manifest2 Module
The manifest2 module parses the Kubernetes manifest received from the
`polaris_aws_exocompute_cluster_attachment` resource and create Terraform
`kubernetes_manifest` resources from the content.

> [!CAUTION]
> The resources in the Kubernetes manifest generated by RSC needs to be applied
> in a specific order. This module tries to replicate the order by applying the
> Kubernetes resources in order based on their kind. This might not work in
> future versions of the manifest. The manifest1 module will always apply the
> Kubernetes resources in the correct order.
